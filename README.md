# Event-Management-with-ASP.NET
The Event Management with ASP.NET project is a web application built using ASP.NET and C# that allows users to manage and organize events efficiently. It follows a multi-tier architecture with:

A Data Access Layer (DAL) for database operations

A Business Logic Layer (BLL) for core application rules

A front-end layer within the EventManagementFinal project, delivering a user-friendly web interface

This structure ensures clean separation of concerns, making the system scalable and easy to maintain. It is suitable for use in event planning, registration, and administrative management.
